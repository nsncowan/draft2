    <h1 id="resultsHeading" class="hidden">Results!</h1>

    <p id="result1" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name1">____</span>, you should learn Rust. Robots fear rust (both the language and the chemical process). But boy do they respect its power!</p>

    <p id="result2" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name2">___</span>, you should learn C#. Because why not?</p>

    <p id="result3" class="hidden">I bet you thought I was going to suggest python, <span id="name3">___</span>. You'd like that, wouldn't you? <br><span id="name4">___</span>, you can't just pick a language because is named after a snake. That's a horrible reason, and a little weird if I'm being honest. I don't even want to tell you my suggestion, now. Oh, well, ok....um...I guess...Ruby??? Yeah, sure. Ruby. Let's go with that.</p>

    <p id="result4" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name5">____</span>, you should learn Swift. I don't have a joke for this language.</p>

    <p id="result5" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name6">____</span>, you should learn Java. Is it a language? An island? A cup of coffee? Who knows? I sure don't...but more importantly - neither will the robots!</p>

    <p id="result6" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name7">____</span>, you should learn Perl. Not the language. I mean the knitting technique. Because let's be real, here - we're all going to be making our own clothes when the rubber meets the road.</p>
