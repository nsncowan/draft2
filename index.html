<!-- potential result 1 -->
<p id="result1" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name">____</span> you should learn Rust.</p>

<!-- potential result 2 -->
<p id="result2" class="hidden">Based on our calculations, <span id="name">___</span> you should learn C#.</p>

<!-- potential result 3 (Python) -->
<p id="result3" class="hidden">I bet you thought I was going to suggest python, <span id="name"></span>. You'd like that, wouldn't you? <span id="name"></span>, you can't just pick a language because is named after a snake. That's a horrible reason, and a little weird if I'm being honest. I don't even want to tell you my suggestion, now. Oh, well, ok....um...I guess...Ruby??? Yeah, sure. Ruby. Let's go with that.</p>
